##Restricting Access:

I have set up restrictions for buying listings wherin the owner of the listing cannot buy their own listing.
Additionally, every listing transaction has a record of the original owner of the listing in order to trace the lifecycle of the listing.

## Maintaining statuses for a listing:
Ensured that every listing has a current state status to indicate whether or not it has been sold. this ensures that even if the listing is still on blockchain, someone else cannot buy it and transfer funds to the owner.
